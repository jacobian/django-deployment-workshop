# PostgreSQL configuration file (/etc/postgresql/8.4/main/postgresql.conf)
#
# The OS-supplied postgresql.conf has every configuration directive known
# to man, and is actually worth reading through carefully. For simplicity,
# though, this is a stripped-down version with only the changes from the
# defaults included.

# Ubuntu puts some files in non-default locations:

# so we need at least 80 connections. Add an additional 5 for superusers,
# monitoring, etc.

#
# WAL archiving
#
# Turn this on when it's time to replicate. It'll archive WAL files to
# /pg_standby, where they'll be picked up and moved to the standby server.
